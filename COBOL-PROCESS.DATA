        XOPTS(SP)   is commonly used in CICS COBOL programs when
                    "systems programming" CICS commands are included
                    (vs. "application programming" CICS commands);
        APOST       specifies the apostrophe character as the
                    string literal delimiter (the site default);
        QUOTE       specifies the double-quote character as the
                    string literal delimiter;
        DATA(24)
        DATA(31)    overrides the storage location for dynamic data
                    areas such as WORKING-STORAGE and file I/O;
        RMODE(24)
        RMODE(ANY)  overrides the relocation mode for the generated
                    object code;
        TRUNC(STD)
        TRUNC(OPT)
        TRUNC(BIN)  overrides the type of truncation used for binary,
                    numeric data fields (STD is the ANSI COBOL 85
                    standard, which truncates on the actual PICTURE;
                    OPT uses the full binary boundary but optimizes
                    for performance leaving accuracy to your coding
                    safeguards; BIN, the site default, uses the full
                    binary boundary for the half-word, full-word, or
                    double-word regardless if fewer digits are speci-
                    fied in the COBOL PICTURE clause -- for example,
                    you can't specify PIC S9(5) for a half-word,
                    binary field but if you move the value of an
                    S9(4) binary field to an S9(5) display (zoned)
                    field the 5th digit will be there for values
                    from -32768 to -10000 and +10000 to +32767);
